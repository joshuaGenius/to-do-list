# to-do-list
The To-Do List Manager is a responsive and interactive task management web application.developed in 15hrs

I have updated all the files except nodemodules as its size is big you can use npi to install nodemodules and all the relevant packages need for this project
Firebase is connected with my configuratons so you can use it dont ned for a change and you can add datas to my database as i made it open source
Then run the project using ng serve 
The list page appears  
The list page contains two sections one for inprogress tasks and otherone is for the completed one
And the header has add task button and sorting options like date wise or workwise (It is the or option so you can sort only by datewise or category wise)
Addlist you get a reactive form page of add task there you can  enter the details for the task (Note:Selecting todays date will me moved to timed out for testing purpose)
If the form is valid and all is perfect you can create a task
The task will be moved to inprogress depending on the date selected \
If the task is completed you can move the task to completed by clicking on the task and selecting mark as completed
timed out task can not be moved to completed you need to update its due date after updating the due date i can  be moved to completed
there is no edit option for completed task but you can  delete completed task
You will get notified if the task is moved to time out
Every time you update date or delete you may need to confirm for the deletion
As real time the tasks cannot be altered only its dates can be altred and it can be deleted
